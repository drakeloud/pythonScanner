# pythonScanner
Python Scanner for running TCP or UDP scans on python3

## Installation:

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Make the python script an executable
3. Scan!

## Usage:
* The script takes arguments in this fashion:
  ```
  ./pythonScanner ipaddress ports optionalFlags
  ```
* If you want to run several ip addresses, then use CIDR notation. E.g.
  ```
  ./pythonScanner 192.168.1.1/28 80
  ```
* If you want to run several ports, simply separate the ports with a comma. E.g.
  ```
  ./pythonScanner 192.168.1.1/28 21,22,25,53,80
  ```
* By default, TCP ports are scanned but by using the UDP flag, it will scan UDP, not TCP. E.g.
  ```
  ./pythonScanner 192.168.1.1/28 21,22,25,53,80 -u
  ```
* If you are lost, just check out the help menu! E.g.
  ```
  ./pythonScanner -h
  ```
> Good luck! and happy scanning!
